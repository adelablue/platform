# Introduction

The platform connects tech projects, public and private initiatives, problems, crowdsourcing of problems and crowdsourcing of ideas to solve problems, resources (cash, products & services, etc) and their respective sponsors, volunteers. The platform is a nexus for community building and collaboration and a resource to bootstrap non profits and profits alike? that are doing things that target the integration process.

The platform is made up of major parts(overlapping):

* Project Hub: Contains Projects and Organizations
* Resource Hub: Funding (Grants(Cash, Material(Office space, Laptops, etc), Products&Services(Slack, Github, Etc), Knowledge(Expertise(Skills*Time):Volunteering, Information resources))
* Knowledge Hub: Problems, Solutions, Ideas, Q&A, Forum  ,, ; Is crowdsourced 
* Associations: Relationships exist between project, problems they target, other projects targeting a specific problem, partners/financers/volunteers of a projects, etc.

# The purpose and background of the project hub

The project hub focuses on projects that are doing things for the integration of newly arrived. Tech projects are projects focuses on tech. There are other initiatives such as publicly or privately run refugee camps, transit housing, volunteering networks such as Welcome to Sweden, and so on.

The purpose of the project hub can be summarized in the following list:

* Facilitate networking
* Between existing projects to create synergies, find joint solutions to shared problems
* Between people in the community having similar ideas to start an initiative
* Between projects and volunteering private people and expert resources and public authorities

* Through an integration with the Resource Hub
* Facilitate projects and initative resource gathering


# High level requirements of the minimum viable project hub

* Projects should be able to “apply” to be listed on the project hub.
* Tech projects and other initiatives are made distinct on the hub which makes it easy for visitors to know what kind of project it is*.
* Projects are searchable and filterable. They are presented in a nice and compelling list. Filter parameters are based on problem category that the project is targeting.
* Projects can be targeting one or more specific issues under some category. These specific issues exists in our problem hub as uniquely identifiable issues that has been found through our workshop or crowdsourcing activities.
* Projects have profiles that give information about their project and what they are doing and for whom. The previously mentioned “targeting” issues that projects are trying to solve is visible in the project profile. Clicking on such an issue shows a short summary of that issue. One can also browse to and redirect to that issue on the problem hub.
* Projects can make request for assistance. The format of these requests (when published) should be similar to Problems and presented as “project specific” problems **.
  
`*` The most important reason for this distinction is our view of other initiatives not focusing on tech to be problem owners; those who are working most closely with refugees. As problem owners they are potential users or partners with tech 
focused projects. This makes it important to facilitate cooperation between them. To make them distinct in the project hub 
lifts this point somewhat. Of course tech project could be working just as close with refugees as other projects. But tech is a tool that needs to be distributed and applied. Most tech initiatives therefore needs partners who are working directly with refugees and who can distribute their tech solutions.

 `**`This data/presentation structure will create coherence throughout the platform and “drilldown” use cases. For example
one could start by browsing categories of Issue/problems on the problem/issue hub, then drill down to specific Problems and further down to projects specific problems that are faced by projects targeting those issue. Finally one could be able to assist to a project specific issue using ones resources or knowledge as requested or by reaching out with a different idea of how one might be of assistance.
